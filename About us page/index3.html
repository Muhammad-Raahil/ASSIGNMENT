                  pre-school days as their parents were close friends. Benny has the same interest as Imran does,
                  which is entrepenuership. He was below average in school and his classmates used to mock him for that.
                  He dropped out of his nursing diploma to pursue interest in business. That was when he and Imran had the idea
                  and started working on the multi-million business you see today.
